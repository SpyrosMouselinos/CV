## üíº Work Experience
(Oct  2021 ‚Äì Now): **PhD Student, University of Warsaw**<br>
**Research Area:** Visual Reasoning in Deep Learning<br>
My research focuses on the exploration of reasoning capabilities in Machine Learning.<br>
- In project, Measuring CLEVRness: Black-box testing of visual reasoning models, we transform a 
typical visual question answering setting into a two-player adversary game of 2 reinforcement learning 
agents. During this game, reasoning gaps of the visual models under test are exposed.
It has been accepted in ICLR 2022 conference.<br>
- In A Simple, Yet Effective Approach to Finding Biases in Code Generation, we 
have shown that current code generation systems exhibit undesired biases inherited 
from their large language model backbones, which can reduce the quality of the generated 
code under specific circumstances. An automated intervention mechanism was introduced,
that exposes undesired biases through the failure modes of the models under test.
This work was accepted in ACL 2023.<br>
- Currently, I am focused on geometric reasoning of LLMs and VLMs and 
exploring ways to improve such models on this field, so fundamental to human reasoning.

(Oct  2021 ‚Äì Now): **Teaching Assistant, University of Warsaw**<br>
Responsible for conducting laboratories in the Natural Language Processing 
Course and Visual Recognition Course of master‚Äôs degree study cycle in university of Warsaw,
Department of Informatics (MIMUW).
<br><br>


(March 2021 ‚Äì Oct 2021): **Research Assistant, University of Warsaw** <br>
**Research Area:** Visual Reasoning and Neurosymbolic Approaches. <br>
Under the supervision of Henryk Michalewski and Mateusz Malinowski,
we investigate the effect of Neurosymbolic Neural Networks as well as 
Adversarial Agents towards testing the limits of VR/VQA tasks.
During this work, an interactive application that acts as a neural 
network testbed has been created, enabling better understanding of
pretrained visual reasoning architectures.

(Nov 2018 ‚Äì February 2021): **Lead Machine Learning Engineer** - Deepsea Technologies<br>
As a Lead, I was responsible for the following projects:<br>
-	Uncertainty Estimation/ Anomaly Detection.<br>
Used Deep Quantile Networks to forecast and report anomalies on tankers and cargo ships of 5 major 
worldwide corporations. Proposed better engine usage schemas and reduced fuel costs by 4%, as well as
detected oil-theft on various ships.<br>

-   Deep Learning Based Ship Route Optimization.<br>
Used Generative Adversarial Networks to Simulate Ship Performance 
under different weather conditions and created a better Deep Learning
boosted variant of the Graph Based A*(A star) algorithm. Managed to 
automatically create routes for over 100 ships at real-time, with the algorithm 
outperforming current solutions by 8-10%.<br>

-	AIS System Based - Fuel and Hull Fouling Estimation over Sparse Data.
Used Time Series Deep Neural Networks and Feature Engineering based on Geolocation
Trajectories in order to report fuel consumption and power consumption based solely 
on sparse and corrupt AIS Data. Created a robust system that can classify performance 
deterioration and assess the overall state of a ship.
<br><br>

(Dec 2017 ‚Äì Nov 2018): **Machine Learning Engineer** - Deepsea Technologies<br>
As an ML Engineer, I was responsible for the following projects:<br>
-	Product Pipeline Design.<br>
Successfully containerized and published all Deep Learning Projects with Docker and Flask. 
Created a multi-worker high-availability system with Gunicorn, and balanced incoming traffic using Nginx.
Finally, all projects were deployed on AWS Cloud and a combination of Jenkins and Coverage were used 
to maintain CI/CD. That lead to the creation of a ‚Äúclick-and-play‚Äù Deep-Learning  project base for over 200 
ships and 5 different companies.<br>

-	Modeling ‚ÄúAging‚Äù Phenomenon on Mechanical Parts.<br>
In this project we aimed to model the magnitude of  ‚Äúaging‚Äù on different mechanical parts 
and automatically suggest their Remaining Useful Life (RUL).
We used a combination of classical Machine Learning and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks 
and built a real-time monitor/tracker that was deployed on every ship. By suggesting maintenance 
and repair we reduced costs of ship maintenance by 10%.
